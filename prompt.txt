“Design a modern, dynamic personal portfolio website for Pradyun Kumar Sinha, an AI/ML and Web Developer studying at BPDC.
The site should combine iOS design aesthetics with tech-startup energy — clean, fluid, and immersive.

Use glassmorphism, subtle gradients, smooth transitions, and interactive animations to make the interface come alive.
Every button and link should be fully functional, with seamless navigation and polished motion effects.

🧠 Overall Design Language

Inspired by Apple’s iOS design — soft light/dark contrast, blurred backgrounds, and rounded corners (2xl).

Typography: SF Pro or similar clean sans-serif.

Colors: whites, off-grays, translucent panels, and accent gradients (light blue to purple).

Motion: smooth fade-ins, parallax hero, gentle hover animations, and section transitions using Framer Motion or similar.

Layout: fully responsive grid; optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

📍 Sections
1. Hero Section

Prominently display:
Name: Pradyun Kumar Sinha
Title: AI/ML and Web Developer
Subtitle: Studying at BPDC

Add soft glow or gradient accent behind the name.

Include two functional buttons:

View My Work → Smooth-scroll to Projects section

About Me → Smooth-scroll to About section

Add minimal particle or gradient motion in the background for depth.

2. About Section

Glass card layout with profile image placeholder and a short intro:
“Hi, I’m Pradyun — passionate about building intelligent systems and modern web experiences. Currently studying at BPDC, exploring the intersection of AI and full-stack development.”

Include a glowing divider and subtle fade-up animation on scroll.

3. Work Experience Section

Display as interactive vertical timeline or stacked glass cards with motion.

Entries:

AI Research Intern — DeepMind Labs (Remote, 2024)

4. Projects Section

Animated project grid or carousel.

Each project card has a hover animation, a blurred overlay, and a “Learn More” button that opens a working modal or link.

Example projects:

NeuraNote – AI-powered note summarizer using NLP.

WebGenie – Dynamic website generator built with React and Flask.

VisionScan – Image classification app for object detection.

ChatForge – Chatbot platform leveraging fine-tuned LLMs.

5. Skills Section

Display skill icons in glowing or animated cards.

Include Python, TensorFlow, React, Flask, Next.js, and Git.

Optional: animated circular progress indicators or hover motion on icons.

6. Footer / Connect Section

Minimal footer with soft gradient background and frosted glass style.

Add “Let’s Connect” text (no contact form needed).

Include functional LinkedIn and GitHub icons linking to placeholder URLs.

Ensure hover glow and responsive alignment.

⚙️ Functionality Requirements

All navigation buttons must scroll smoothly to target sections.

Light/dark mode toggle styled like iOS settings.

All animations must feel smooth (use easing and delays).

Modal popups and buttons should be functional.

Page transitions should fade or slide elegantly.

Fully responsive design.

Tone:
Polished, dynamic, and futuristic — a showcase of innovation and technical creativity wrapped in Apple-like elegance.
